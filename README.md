# Tic Tac Toe
This project is a Tic Tac Toe game developed with React Native. 
It allows two players to play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe on the same device, switching turns between "X" and "O".
The game detects a win or a draw and displays a message with the outcome, offering a "Play Again" button to restart the game.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay on the same device.
- Custom images for "X" and "O".
- Win and draw detection with an inline modal announcement.
- "Play Again" functionality to restart the game.
